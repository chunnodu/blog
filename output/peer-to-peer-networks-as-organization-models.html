  </header>
  <p>Are there any similarities between peer-to-peer networks in computing and the nature of operations in Africa? I'm inclined to think so. </p>
<p>Using Nigeria as an example, it is noticed that although the citizens are highly entrepreneurial, the entrepreneurship traits do not scale in a meaningful way as large organizations are still usually ineffective.</p>
<p>How about a new organizational paradigm of loosely coupled peers - a network of peers who self-organize to complete specific pieces of work.</p>
<p>The task would be to 
- Define this paradigm 
- List concrete examples of its occurrence in the Nigerian context
- Compare effectiveness to traditional organizations
- Assemble best practices and 
- Spread this model of organization </p>
<p>Local data would be critical as local data is contextual, and context is key. </p>
