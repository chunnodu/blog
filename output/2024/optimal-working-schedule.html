  </header>
  <p>When I consulted for a Long Island market research firm in 2017-18, a development manager I worked with had an offset schedule where he got to go home at 3pm because he started off early.
That was a pivotal moment in my journey to design the optimal work life as I realized that for knowledge work, all that’s needed is some overlap time everyday with co-workers, not really all of your time.</p>
<p>Once I got the chance, I tried a similar schedule. While living in Dallas on central time, I still worked an early eastern time shift, meaning I was able to close at 3pm local time. Having late afternoons to evenings free weren’t as great as I thought though, I ended up spending a lot of those hours asleep after work. Businesses like the bank had just an hour, so I had to scramble to make it there. My conclusion? having to work first thing in the morning wasn’t healthy. I need some me time to start the day. </p>
<p>Also, it meant exercising in the evenings, but my motivation dwindles as the day goes by so naturally a lot of workouts were missed. I think the feeling and motivation boost from exercise works better for me in the mornings to start the day.</p>
<p>Since I’m away from North America this quarter, I’m testing out starting work between noon and 3pm, and closing off about 9 hours later. So far, it feels great as I get my most productive hours in the day to focus on me. I can read, workout, learn, and run any personal errands before noon. It seems like I’ve been able to move work to fill up hours when I wouldn’t really be motivated to do much else. Also, I have more time to map out my work day subconsciously instead of rolling right into it. Jury’s still out, but so far so good.</p>
