  </header>
  <p>The combination of ego and a strong desire to keep my word has had me struggle sometimes with people's requests, but one thing i'm learning as an adult is to feel better about saying No.</p>
<p>Typically, when I request a favor it involves reading between the lines - any response that's not an eager yes means a no. I allow the responder gracefully ease out of it without pushing, but not everyone works that way.</p>
<p>Some folks don't get the hint, so from experience going quiet or saying I'll get back to them  piles on more pressure and doesn't close things.<br>
Now, when uneasy about a request I'm learning to plainly say no even if I can't explain exactly why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'd like to loan you the money you requested, but will need it before you can pay it back."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I got overwhelmed and won't be able to." </p>
<p>"I thought I could get it done easily but it's more complex than I imagined"</p>
<p>"Things have changed since i said yes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also remind myself to raise a white flag early and renegotiate if I can't continue as expected, and that this is way better than a broken agreement.</p>
