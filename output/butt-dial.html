  <p>Most buttdials these days are actually your hand calling, so it’s easy to forget, or depending on how old you are, not even realize that the word comes from a real time when phones had call buttons that could be pressed when you sat on them</p>
<p>A friend called me and I picked up, only to see a close up view of the bottom half of what was <em>clearly</em> a female figure, walking. After seconds I started to see water splash on the camera lens, and on the figure, so I had to hang up for fear of being a peeping tom. The back story is she was traveling and in the rain, and that was a literal butt dial, powered by FaceTime.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see how words  can evolve and have even more meanings with the passage of time, or how an event could make you understand or remember the core meaning of a word.</p>
