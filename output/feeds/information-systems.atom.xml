I'm inclined to think so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Nigeria as an example, it is noticed that although the citizens are highly entrepreneurial, the entrepreneurship traits do not scale in a meaningful way as large organizations are still usually ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about a new organizational paradigm of loosely coupled peers - a network of peers who self-organize to complete specific pieces of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task would be to 
- Define this paradigm 
- List concrete examples of its occurrence in the Nigerian context
- Compare effectiveness to traditional organizations
- Assemble best practices and 
- Spread this model of organization &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local data would be critical as local data is contextual, and context is key. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Information Systems"></category></entry></feed>
