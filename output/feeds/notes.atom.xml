&lt;p&gt;It was a family vacation, and since i ended up biking a lot in the last couple of days out there, it naturally became a part of the conversation. My aunt and uncle asked several questions to understand how the system worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you pay?
Do you have to return the bike?
What if you steal the bike?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conclusion that it was innovative became stronger as we tried to poke holes in their business model and couldn't find any flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became more curious about all things bike share and have resolved to do some more research about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who owns social bikes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Cities and States are covered by their network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer base?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of bikes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are asian bike sharing companies and what kind of bikes do they use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lyft acquires biggest biking network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Notes"></category></entry><entry><title>On Firsts: Cutting my Hair</title><link href="https://chunnodu.com/on-firsts-cutting-my-hair.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-08-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Chu Nnodu</name></author><id>tag:chunnodu.com,2016-08-11:/on-firsts-cutting-my-hair.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning, looking in the mirror made me wish I could cut my own hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, this wasn’t always a thing. In Nigeria, I had haircuts weekly or every 2 weeks - depending on free time, and need. The price was negligible, so I’d never had to budget for a haircut. 
It’s been about 3 years of $20-$30 haircuts. They add up, and sometimes I avoid going into the barbershop twice in one calendar month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that many people simply cut their own hair, I decided to learn whenever the chance came. My cousin could and the convenience this ability brought, plus time &amp;amp; cost savings weren’t lost on me. So far I’d been able to manage shaving and doing a little side fade with my clippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday and I need to be in the office by afternoon, so there are only a few hours to sort out my hair situation. I grab the clippers and get to work. It’s somewhat straightforward - set the comb, trim the hair in an area to that level, repeat accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway into it I realize that any mistakes will have me looking like a mad man for the rest of the day (at least).
Moore’s law holds up because as I round up, the comb slips off and the naked blade runs through my hair, leaving a stroke that’s lower than everything else. A close look shows this, and some other weird looking patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I cut my hair for the first time. It wasn’t perfect &amp;amp; the worst almost happened, but I learned how to get better. Sneaky feeling: this might be a great way to figure stuff out. 
Here’s what &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0"&gt;Shia LaBeouf says&lt;/a&gt;. I think I agree.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Notes"></category></entry></feed>
