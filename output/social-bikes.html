  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was in New Orleans for a wedding and noticed the blue bikes just like in New York, D.C. and the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>It was a family vacation, and since i ended up biking a lot in the last couple of days out there, it naturally became a part of the conversation. My aunt and uncle asked several questions to understand how the system worked.</p>
<p>How do you pay?
Do you have to return the bike?
What if you steal the bike?</p>
<p>Our conclusion that it was innovative became stronger as we tried to poke holes in their business model and couldn't find any flaws.</p>
<p>I became more curious about all things bike share and have resolved to do some more research about them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who owns social bikes?</li>
<li>What Cities and States are covered by their network?</li>
<li>Customer base?</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>What kinds of bikes?</li>
<li>What are asian bike sharing companies and what kind of bikes do they use?</li>
<li>Lyft acquires biggest biking network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
