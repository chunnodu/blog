I took piano lessons as a teenager from when i was around 12-14. Mr. Johnson was a good teacher, we used Smallwood's piano tutorial and by the time i gave it up i was able to play pieces in C, G and F. Now? I can only play basic nursery rhymes from memory, but at least I have an ear for music, or a brain that thinks so.

On the other hand some kids I grew up with learned how to play the piano at church. They probably still picked up reading music along the way, but if i remember correctly they learned chords first, then how to freestyle and improv to accompany the choir's songs until they got really good, picked up multiple instruments and could soon play in the grown-up choir. I bet they can still play today.

They had the spark, I had some theory and even back then when I couldn't articulate it, I could tell there was a difference. With the benefit of experience i understand now that [both](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/episteme-techne/) techne - *know how*, and episteme - *know what/why* are necessary for really brilliant work.
 
When I talk about childhood with native-born Americans, the options, tools and resources they had available to develop potential in almost any area are fascinating for someone who grew up outside the western world. Structured programs, mentoring, camps, even having affordable chains of stores dedicated to games, music equipment, arts and craft?  Mind-blowing, and priceless to a 3rd world child. "You should all be prodigy's with that much formative experience, and the world of possibilities it unlocks" is what i keep thinking. 

Yesterday a  friend and I agreed that just as 3rd world kids were heavy on creativity but lacking in the tools and resources to take their craft to the next level, what was usually missing on this end was that spark of curiosity, creativity or the chance of some real world application that made folks persist and actually master the craft until their work got outstanding.

The shift that's happening now in Africa is that with technology like the internet and mobile phones, people with *the spark* are either finding the tools and resources to build up their theory and practice, or getting connected to people who already have this down pat. Bottom line: an explosion of both technical talent and creative genius - Afrobeat artistes blowing up is the old story, professional talent is on the come up too with the producers, designers, business people, writers. Even getting more technical - African developers and designers are starting to write software and design experiences that the world uses, without having left the continent. 

They had the theory and tools, but we have the spark - and with practice in the coming years, you'll see how that can make things different.
