I haven't read as much as i could this year, so thought it would be good to do a dump of everything I have going on on the book front, just to keep track somewhere outside my head.

## Read recently 
- Lateral thinking, Ed de Bono: Long, arduous read that slowed my reading pace for months, but great because it helped me understand more about how the mind operates. I feel confident that I have the basic skills in lateral thinking now, and can always refer to it when needed.
- Secrets of Consulting: Another read that took longer than needed, lots of fieldstones but unfortunately I wasn’t capturing them when reading.
- A technique for producing ideas 


## Currently I’m reading

### Hardcopy:

- Product Managemement Sacred Seven: It’s a 650+ page textbook and I’m about halfway through. I’ve been reading and mindmapping notes so it hasn’t been the fastest.

- How to be Rich by Paul Getty. This one snuck into my reading list and I plan to finish it this week. I love books from the 60’s, and no it’s NOT a get rich quick book, haha.

### Digital

- Weingberg on Writing: The fieldstone method - I like this one a lot, needed something more free flowing after all the dense books this year, plus I’ve already learned things I can apply right away.

- Generating product ideas


## I’m looking forward to reading.

I didn’t start off the year with these books on my reading list but they’re great additions, so there.

- Slow Productivity: Cal Newport

- Ghostroots - Pemi Aguda: Yo, [Pemi wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/Ghostroots-Stories-Pemi-Aguda/dp/1324065850). What better way to seal our debate about the need for fiction than to write one?

- The Halo Effect.
