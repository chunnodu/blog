## Next Steps: DLVR 2.0
Build a listing site which becomes the premier destination for finding delivery agents, riders and delivery product and service providers.
Our customers will be businesses, organizations, individuals.
Our delivery method will be map based on our website and also via messaging apps e.g whatsapp.
    
### 9 things we must do well
1. Keep an updated listing of all delivery players(delivery agents, riders, delivery product and service providers)
2. Verify identity of users who will be actors on our platform.
3. Provide a way for users to add to our listing and view information without leaving messaging apps like whatsapp, telegram.
4. Show points of interest from our listing visually on a map with analytics.
5. Provide a way to rate and review delivery actors.
6. Take payment for deliveries, forward to provider.
7. Recommend delivery products and services.
8. Maintain a Blacklist of riders or delivery service providers.
9. Offer a store for purchasing delivery products and services. 

### Approach to Product Development
Shape Up: Pick things we can scope to deliver in 6 weeks.
Reward developers with bounties for features shipped, not paid full-time employment.
Promote the best solutions using our listing, whether or not we built them.
Collaborate with the ecosystem on the roadmap to make deliveries better.
