If you’re someone who likes to do a lot of things, you might get in a situation where you’re juggling too many balls and one eventually drops.

I lost a client recently and it was a bummer because I had gotten through the hump of getting immersed in the project, and things were starting to take shape.

Here’s how I moved forward

- Take responsibility. Even when circumstances might not allow you to do so publicly, make sure that in your quiet moments you have thought through the situation and identified areas you fell short and can improve on.

- Don’t nuke the bridge. Retreat as gracefully as you can, deliver any work in progress.
 
- Get over yourself. It’s not the end of the world.At the very least You’re more experienced than you were before this.

- Give additional value beyond any contracts or agreements.

- Send a report at the close of a project. It’s a good way to recap, document lessons learned and milestones, and move on.
