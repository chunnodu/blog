# Hidden Gems


In the last year of my 20’s I lived down the street from a fruit market. It was off the main street with lots of shops, restaurants and bars. Great options for hanging out with friends when you wanted to keep it local, or even a casual date. There was also constant foot traffic of people, so you hardly felt "alone".

It was super walkable, with interesting things to see and do for a couple of miles each way. 5 minutes walk to the park which had a river bank, great view, exercise equipment, a running track, sports field and picnic areas. I was at the park almost every day, enjoying all these options for fitness, doing yoga or just hanging out.

A 6 minute walk and you were at the train station which could take you anywhere in New Jersey. 20 minutes to NYC riding the fast train, or 28 on the slow one, and 35 minutes driving to NYC with no traffic (haha), 15 minutes away from EWR, where there are direct flights everywhere, even to Africa.

I lived in the Ironbound in Newark, New Jersey when the pandemic hit. Why live in a city known for crime, drugs, poverty, violence? Well, I went to grad school there years ago so I could go off what I knew, not just what I’d heard about it. Zooming into the specifics, the quality of life for less than 10% of my income made it a pretty great deal. 

Have you ever gotten more value than you’ve paid or would expect for something? That’s what I call a hidden gem, but you have to be open-minded to see it. From experience there’s more gems out there, just waiting to be discovered.
