Are there any similarities between peer-to-peer networks in computing and the nature of operations in Africa? I'm inclined to think so. 

Using Nigeria as an example, it is noticed that although the citizens are highly entrepreneurial, the entrepreneurship traits do not scale in a meaningful way as large organizations are still usually ineffective.

How about a new organizational paradigm of loosely coupled peers - a network of peers who self-organize to complete specific pieces of work.

The task would be to 
- Define this paradigm 
- List concrete examples of its occurrence in the Nigerian context
- Compare effectiveness to traditional organizations
- Assemble best practices and 
- Spread this model of organization 

Local data would be critical as local data is contextual, and context is key.
