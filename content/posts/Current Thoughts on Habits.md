Title: Current Thoughts on Habits

My thinking on routines and habits has started to shift, probably because of what I’m being exposed to on twitter about how habits are overrated, and what matters is the desire to do something. So, this is a timestamp of my still evolving thoughts.

While I agree that no type of regimen can replace the genuine interest and desire to dive in, I think routines are important for that phase of doing things even when you don’t want to, as a way to build the habit, get to the point where it’s second nature, and hopefully, generate that genuine desire eventually.

So while I’m not going to swing all the way and become anti James Clear and habits, I will try to find or clarify the deeper meaning behind each habit I incorporate.

For instance, my primary motivation for riding a bike is the feeling of freedom and feeling light while cycling, exploring the world faster than a walking pace, having enough places to go to that are easy bike rides away and  knowing I’m getting a great workout all the same.
If I was riding just to check off a workout (hello peloton owners) I guarantee it’d happen less often.


I will also try to limit the number of habits I try to work on at the same time. If it takes 30 consecutive days to build a habit, I realistically have enough room to build 6-9 great habits every year. That sounds like more than enough.
