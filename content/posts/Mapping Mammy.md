After a few trial runs testing Retailytics with stakeholders and some early users they enlisted, it was clear that we needed to stress-test the application in a controlled environment, a sandbox where we could collect some proof of concept data and also capture any usability issues with the application before rolling it out to a wider audience.

It struck me that the NYSC camp could be the perfect testing ground because of two key resources - corps members aggregated in one location, and a market - mammy!

Every Nysc camp has a mammy market. Predominantly filled with bars/restaurants/canteens/kitchens, there are also other stores. In my own time on camp I remember passing by a barber, and having a tailor amend my uniform.

A week should be sufficient for each enumerator to signup for the application, get assigned, and map out as many stores as they could. 
We’ll give cash prizes for the top 3 mappers, and also shortlist the top 10-20 as enumerators when the project goes live. 

Mapping Mammy is possible in 3 easy steps.

1. Join the [telegram channel](https://t.me/+Dd2Kd1shy7lkZjMx) which has these resources.
	- link to the [landing page](www.retailytics.ajared.ng)
	- demo video for using the app
2. Sign up to use the application at [www.retailytics.ajared.ng](https://www.retailytics.ajared.ng)
3. When you are verified, start mapping stores in Mammy Market with Retailytics.
