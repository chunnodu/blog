I hate giving excuses, but sometimes a dog really ate my homework. Life can really throw a row of curve-balls that are really hard to explain to someone who wasn’t present but, make you miss a deliverable.

So, the reason today’s post about how I shouldn’t have hacked my blog together will not published as scheduled, even though it was written is because I broke my blog and don’t have time just yet figure out how to resolve the conflicts and push something somewhere.
