Telegram is objectively the best messenger app in the world. I say objectively because when you look across measurable factors like privacy, ease of use, UX, features and performance, it clearly wins. 

Since I work in product, this is very aspirational: to be in a category where I can build the objectively best product in the world. What would that category look like right now? 
Maybe a hodge podge of all the things I have a keen interest in, a lot of experience in or happen to be really good at? 

Let's chat if you’re building a product related to graphs x analytics x mapping x last mile logistics x retail x workflow automation x ai. Or maybe at least 2 or 3 of these. I'll help make it the best in the world.
