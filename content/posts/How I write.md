Title: How I write

The idea usually comes first, sometimes in the middle of an experience that makes me go “hmm, I should write about this”
Depending on where this happens I’ll probably write down the topic or keyword and then flesh it out gradually until the day I decide to ship the post. 

In a journal/notebook, I capture the core idea and if it isn’t explicit yet, at least a sentence I can use to understand my thoughts later on. If walking, I leave a voice note or scribble in my pocketbook. When commuting/traveling, probably in the notes folder on my phone but if on my computer then that’s great because  I can start a new branch in a mind map and map topics and keywords out. 

When I actually sit-down to write? I open my typewriter for the last 7 years, IA writer in full-screen mode to avoid distractions. 
I put all the individual ideas down and flesh each one out into paragraphs, maybe starting with the intro, but moving on quickly if it doesn’t flow.

Then I edit, check for sentences that are too wordy or ramble, structure the paragraphs, connect them, and add in extras like photos or links, preview in IA writer, and then go publish it somewhere.
