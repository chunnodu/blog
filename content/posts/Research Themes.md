These are the current areas my research is focused on.

## Building a local agent network.
Use Case: A network of information systems agents, equipped with mobile devices and the internet, specializing in improving last-mile logistics.

## Designing standards for SMEs delivery operators to manage their last-mile logistics operations and share them peer-to-peer across the network.
Use Case: Escrow, KYC, Ratings and Reviews, Regulation and Licensing for Last Mile Logistics Operators in Africa.

## Research Question: Are there optimal patterns for successful African businesses? 
- Are they fractal(recursive?)
- Can Information Systems(mobile, internet) enhance these patterns or reproduce them?

## Knowledge Management: How to harness knowledge networks (e.g diaspora, expert, retirees) to increase intellectual capabilities and consequently, core competencies of a firm.
- make them linked: build and share ontologies
- make them visible: associate with spatial elements and put them on the map
- give them context: tell a story
- reward all the players: explore a participation based rewards model based on proof of work.
