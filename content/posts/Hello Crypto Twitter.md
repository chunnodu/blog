Crypto was one of the largest wealth transfers of my generation, but a regret is that I was on the sidelines, even though I knew about it from 2013. 

For about a year now I’ve been nursing the idea of taking a position again and with the recent crash of 10/10, there’s no better time than the present, so, Hello Crypto Twitter.

My goal is mainly to learn, and be active in case there’s an opportunity for outsize returns. I’ve found that investing money somewhere forces me to pay a more active interest in  that space.

At the very least i'd like to avoid blowing up my portfolio and going to zero, or having to exit before the end of the year.

Here’s my investment strategy. 

**Proposed Portfolio**

- Total Investment = $2,000

- Stable Coins - $1000 - 50%

- BTC - $250 - 12.5%

- Solana - $250 - 12.5%

- ZCash - $300 - 15%

- Monero - $100 - 5%

- Gambling on stable coins - $100 - 5%

**My investment thesis**

- Holding  BTC and stable coin represents my belief that crypto is here to stay, and also some risk management. Besides theft, this is a way to safeguard my portfolio from going to zero.

- Holding Solana because it seems like the Ethereum of this era: ready for application builders. \
	a) I’ve seen superteamNG folks hard at work at sterling bank co-working space in Abuja several times.
	b) a lot of activity and building on this chain, very similar to ethereum last decade. 
	c) Nikita being an advisor is a strong signal.
- Privacy coins (Zcash and Monero) are almost as inevitable as crypto, since not everyone is comfortable with their on-chain activity being exposed for interrogation.
- Degenerate gambling. I hate losing money, so 5% is a great marker of the margin of pure financial risk I typically have appetite for.

**Rules of my game**

- Start out with this initial allocation, adjust fairly conservatively after 3 months, and also share my portfolio balance every month, as a Tiny Experiment.

- If there are strong movements in the market, I can rebalance my allocations to take advantage, taking care not to blow up.

- Complete any crypto side quests for learning or connections.

**Learning areas**

- Mint and sell an NFT

- Purchase and exchange even smaller  crypto/meme coins

- Navigating pumpfun

- Hardware wallets

- Analyzing blockchain transactions

- Smart contracts: a mechanism to distribute money[rewards] for contributors who provide correct data.
