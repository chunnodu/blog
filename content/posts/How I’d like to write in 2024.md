I haven’t figured out my optimal writing routine but this challenge has made me realize I need to, so here’s things I’d like to work on to improve my writing in the new year.

- write on a constant schedule, at a fixed time.
- learn when works best for my writing, since mornings aren’t always reasonable.
- using some method, e.g the bullet journal method to break down my thoughts and learn an easy structure for journaling.
- go beyond casual daily posts with industry focused analysis, probably on a weekly(ambitious), or monthly (bare minimum).
- chaining multiple stories together to explore something in a broader way.
- getting a version 1 of every story worth sharing  currently stuck in my head out.
