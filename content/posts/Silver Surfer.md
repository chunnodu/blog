Sunzone Surfer

No close relation to marvel’s fictional character, a sunzone surfer is a person who has decided to live across timezones, chase the sun, and get more good weather out of the year.

What inspires this? The feeling of life slowing down during the winter, and not wanting to give up 3-4 months of being outdoors in mostly daylight. 

Say no to Seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression. A sun zone surfer can glide away from these kinds of timezone driven adverse conditions, and live in the clime most suitable for ventures at that point in time.

Here is a sample schedule of a sun zone surfer. Perhaps there’s more in this than just a fictional character.
