## Product Priorities for Next Quarter
My proposed order for prioritization is 
1. Automate IT billbacks :(8) _ready for delivery with clear definition of done._ 
2. Renewals & Retention :(7)  _discovery - opportunity ID_
3. Broker app :(3)  _discovery - pains/problem space_
I weighed our upcoming initiatives for the quarter with an eye out for how quickly we could validate any assumptions around customer delight, return on investment(viability) and feasibility.
### Next Actions: Work on discovery and delivery sprints with
- engineers to scope out solution
- finance to understand cost savings
- designer to research breaks in current renewal flow
- customers to understand flow: facility manager - billing + ticketing flow
    member
- sales/marketing - insight into acquisition metrics      
### Assumptions
 -  all broker app are tooling issues - not business process
 -  facilities request are most frequent customer touchpoint
 -  internal knowledge of both systems readily available for integration
