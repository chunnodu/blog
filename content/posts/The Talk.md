As a teenager, depending on how involved your parents were, you probably got some version of “the talk” from your parents. You know, the sex talk. Hopefully it wasn’t prompted by you getting caught in a compromising position, but at a minimum it was some variant of caution about the opposite sex, dating, sex in general, and what kind of behavior is expected or acceptable of you. What they don’t tell you is that if you live twice that long, there’s an adult version of the talk - the marriage talk.

How you should think about marriage, when you should, what kind of person you should marry, if you need help with getting married, why you’re not responding to all the people they show you, if you actually want to get married. All these are fair game for this talk. What’s worse still is that other people in your life who aren’t your parents might feel it necessary to give you this talk as well, so get ready.

Another thing they don’t tell you is that the talk will evolve to be a conversation topic among your peers too. From “hey this person is getting married”, to why they’re not interested in marriage, or not married, or divorced, to why you’re not married. Fascinating stuff. I wonder if there are any other talks which become normal past a certain age, and why no one is warning me in advance about them now.
