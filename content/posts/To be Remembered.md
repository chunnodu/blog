This refreshing video of Adele's reunion with her old teacher spawned a lot of great comments about teachers [on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=never%20forget%20a%20good%20teacher&src=typed_query), where I hang out a lot in my free time.

"You never forget a good teacher", was the common sentiment, as some people shared anecdotes about their favorite teachers. 

Bringing it home, one thing that set apart the teachers I really enjoyed was their attitude and enthusiasm. I'd say their mastery of the subject too, but i suspect that was a natural result of being so interested in and engaged with anything.

Even going beyond teachers - from the girl in my university class who taught me how to win the Minesweeper game and not get blown up (thanks Sylvia!) to my boss after college who showed me how to mind-map(because mind-mapping changed my life) - I think you truly remember anyone who taught you something useful, profound, difficult or remarkable in some other way.

My dad certainly didn't forget the older man at his office who put him on to investing in stocks back in the day, because when I asked about it almost 30 years later, the answer came in seconds.

I can stop the examples now. The point is we never forget good teachers, so to be remembered - teach people things!
