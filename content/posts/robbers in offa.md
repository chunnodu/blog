I saw a post recently on twitter about how banks only opened from 9am - 12pm in [Offa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offa,_Nigeria). Something about it triggered a faint memory, so I looked in the comments to see if there were any explanations. 
True enough to that memory, these short banking hours seemed to be due to a [famous daylight robbery](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/264246-offa-robbery-police-confirm-17-killed-7-suspects-arrested.html) of 4 banks, starting around 4pm . I bet the bankers had a round table meeting after the tragedy and said, “you know robbers are lazier than us. They can’t wake up early to hustle but wait for us to make the money, then they come to steal it. From now on, let’s close early so by the time they wake up, we’ll be gone. Our historical analysis shows that robbers don’t wake up early in Offa.”
