Yesterday I saw snow.

I probably read about snow for the first time when I was three or four. Since then I have seen pictures and videos of it, imagined it, and wondered how I would feel when I saw it.

All my siblings had seen snow, even the last one; who was ten years younger. It was just a coincidence I guess, that I had never been where it snowed, when it did.

I saw snow yesterday, and it was dirty, slippery, and generally very disgusting.
