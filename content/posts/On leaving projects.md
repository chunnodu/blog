Anything worth doing is worth doing well, but sometimes thereâ€™s a fork in the road that means you have to leave a project in your past.  

I strongly believe that the way you leave things also matters just as much as how you behaved while doing the thing.

Ideally how I want to leave projects is: 

- better than when we started off,

- leaving something that can keep growing, with a life of its own, 

- easier to manage going forward, because of the work I did.
