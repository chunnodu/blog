> "Follow you again. Me I no go follow you again."

One way I’ve learned to deal with social media is to aggressively curate my feeds and optimize for my interests.

I also try my best to filter out negative material and preserve my headspace.

This means that if I repeatedly get a bad vibe from your content, no hard feelings but me I no go follow you again.

Now, a bad vibe doesn’t always mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes it could even just be my own ego, insecurity or envy jumping out, but whatever it is, I won’t entertain it in my personal space.

So if your social media content disrupts or pollutes my headspace, kills my vibe? Me I no go follow you again.

P.S If you like Afrobeats, I listened to this young kid called Mavo so many times over the last few weeks that I made a playlist. More on why on earth I like his music, later.
