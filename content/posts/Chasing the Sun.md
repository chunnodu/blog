Does anyone born in temperate weather have any business being in extremely cold regions? Well, if I never saw a winter or white Christmas again, I wouldn’t shed a tear or miss it. It’s always been at the back of my mind that really successful people could chase the sun and enjoy the best weather all year round but I hadn’t given it much thought in recent times.

From having a boat and sailing to warmer climes, to having holiday homes there I’ve heard about different versions of chasing the sun, but none of them really appealed to me this whole time because of the locations. Yes it’s warmer in Mexico, parts of Central America or even Australia but do I really want to live there?

Visiting South Africa while working remotely has shown me that it’s a realistic goal, to have the best of both worlds and enjoy great weather almost all year round. Maybe someday I’ll be able to post about how I made it happen.
