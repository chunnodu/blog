The objective of the retail intelligence team is to gather and make sense of information around retail activities - that is, how people buy and sell.
The primary lens for our observations are:
Residential - where they live.
Commercial - where they do business activities, especially buying and selling.

The technology team will be responsible for building solutions to support this objective.
The business team will be responsible for prospecting for opportunities to build and sell solutions around retail intelligence, customizing our analytics for businesses and organizations.

## Business Model
Our business model will start off using contractors as enumerators. For our pilot in Abuja, we shall source primarily from the NYSC because of

- predictable seasonal availability of contractors in multiple batches.

- institutional memory of similar collaborations for elections, etc.

- 80% of them need/want supplementary income

- geographical spread in terms of distribution across states. 

- hyperlocal spread - in every state they are assigned a PPA*, 
and also a weekly CDS requirement to meet in various districts or LGAs which gives us a physical touchpoint, in a fairly central location with them weekly.

Long term, a key part of our business model will be getting the power of the crowd to help with accurate enumeration. 

Once we have the data, we will provide detailed intelligence including spatial analysis, relationship path analysis, e.t.c.

## Start Up Operations
The technology team has come up with [a simple application](https://retailintelligence.vercel.app) for collecting data we are interested in. Currently it is called the Retail Intelligence App, but could also be called a {XXXX}mapper**. 

The business team can use this to approach any prospects who would like to collect data, to understand their use case and discuss customization for them.

The goal for start-up/proof of concept is to use this application to gather primary data between Sept-Nov 2025, and provide summary analytics in a report, by December 2025.

We will either collect this primary data ourselves for resale as a product, or as a service provided for interested organizations.

## Notes
* PPA - Place of Primary Assignment(Organization)
* {XXXX} - refers to any relevant point of interest e.g Estates would be the {Estate} Mapper.
