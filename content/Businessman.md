An African #businessman who was being interviewed about his profession, responded this way to the question:  **"As a #businessman sir, what do you do?"**

- I do #business: I #deal on #deals
    
- If you have a #gooddeal: you get it to me
    
- If I #like it: I #buy your #deal
    
- If you have #money to #buy my own: I give you my #bill
    
- You #pay: and that's #business
