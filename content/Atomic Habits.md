This read took a while because I was mindmapping my notes, but what a great start to the year. Everyone knows the power of habits, but this deconstructed a lot of specific things about them for me. Major takeaways were
    - stacking habits: chaining various activities together to make them sticky habits. I started a 10pm brush your teeth/plan your 6 top items for the next day routine.
    - planning a fixed time and place for habits you're trying to develop. This worked really well for yoga, running, reading and painting this year.
