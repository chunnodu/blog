I'm a product development leader and enterprise product manager with experience delivering valuable products to thousands of users and millions of customers across retail, logistics, payments and ecommerce industries from startups to the fortune 500. 

I bring resourcefulness, simplicity, innovation and strategic management to new product development.

Forever  curious, I [write here](https://www.ajared.ng) about my research interests in data, product, management, information systems and strategy. This is a digital log.
