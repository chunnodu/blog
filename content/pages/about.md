I manage data products and information systems, creatively using my [background](https://chunnodu.com/pages/resume.html) to deliver value to customers. 

Trained as an engineer, boredom implementing technology without any direct customer focus led to consulting and the search for the right information and systems to design business models and value propoisitions.

I'm also avidly researching information systems in emerging markets. I love learning, simple design, maps, data and modular, open-source systems. This is a digital log.
