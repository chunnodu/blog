I bring clarity of thought & quality execution to product management, creatively using my [background](https://chunnodu.com/pages/resume.html) to design and manage information systems that deliver value to customers. 

Trained as an engineer, boredom implementing technology without any direct customer focus led to consulting, where I discovered [Business Modeling](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) and Value Proposition design and to grad school to learn how to win at strategy with the right information and systems.
My research applies this to solve business problems in emerging markets.

I love learning, simple design, maps, data and open-source systems. This is a digital log.
