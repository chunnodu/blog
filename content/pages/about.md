I manage data products and information systems, creatively using my [background](https://chunnodu.com/pages/resume.html) to deliver value to customers. 

Trained as an engineer, boredom implementing technology without any direct customer focus led to consulting and the search for the right information and systems to design products and business models customers find valuable. My research applies this to emerging markets. 

I love learning, simple design, maps, data and modular systems. This is a digital log.

- [Reading]({tag}/reading) and [Writing]({index}) 
- Long walks, hikes and riding my bicycle
