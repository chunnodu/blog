### Last-Mile Logistics in Africa
I moved back to Nigeria at the end of 2015 to help start the technology company that became [DLVR Logistics](https://www.dlvr.ng). While no longer involved day-to-day, I still am an avid researcher and contribute to new product development in the last-mile logistics space.
