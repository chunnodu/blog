Title: About Me
Date: 2020-08-28 21:38

I bring clarity of thought & quality execution to new technology product development by designing and managing information systems.

After training and starting out as a network engineer, I quickly got bored of implementing technology without any focus on the business or costumer and  that led me to strategy consulting where I discovered [Business Modeling](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) and intentionally designing Value Propositions for customers, and then grad school to learn how businesses use technology for strategic advantage.

Having experienced the full life cycle of data driven products as an analyst and then leading teams, I'm passionate about improvement, innovation, simplicity in design, and open-source software. My research focuses applying information systems commercially in emerging markets to solve business problems, with a hands-on approach to testing and figuring things out.

My [top skills](https://secure.plum.io/p/o93Pr7IyMGN98jHG9suN5A) creatively combine business and tech. This is a digital log.
