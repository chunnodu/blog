Ventures and products I've built or contributed to that *still* have a digital trail.

## [ajaRED Research Inc — Canada](https://www.ajared.ca) · 2025

Building data products and information systems, and sharing learnings in the field of product development and management.

I'm currently exploring knowledge graph based approaches to Retrieval Augmented Generation for these enterprise use cases, building on my earlier research on [personal knowledge graphs](https://github.com/Ajared/pkg/blob/main/personal%20knowledge%20graphs.pdf).

- Customer Support Knowledge base

I joined the retail intelligence collective — our first project is Retailytics.

AI-powered deck analysis platform offering intelligent feedback and insights to help presenters craft clearer, more compelling pitch decks.

## [dLVR Logistics](https://www.dlvr.ng) · 2015

At the end of 2015 I co-founded a technology company called DLVR Logistics. In 2016, we placed [1st out of over 200 teams](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/07/08/world-bank-group-wharton-global-development-finance-innovation-competition-ideas) in the World Bank Ideas for Action competition. We were probably too early to the market, but it was an early attempt at solving delivery and logistics with technology at Africa's last-mile.
