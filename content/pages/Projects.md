A selection of ventures and products I've built or contributed to — from logistics infrastructure to data research and community work.

I joined the retail intelligence collective — our first project is Retailytics.

## [DeckSense](https://decksense.ai) · 2025

## [dLVR Logistics](https://www.dlvr.ng) · 2015

At the end of 2015 I co-founded a technology company called DLVR Logistics. We were probably too early to the market, but it was an early attempt at delivery and logistics technology for Africa's last-mile.
