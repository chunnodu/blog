Title: Me
Date: 2020-08-28 21:38

I bring clarity of thought & quality execution to product management, creatively using my [background](https://chunnodu.com/pages/resume.html) to design and manage information systems that deliver value to customers. 

Trained as an engineer, boredom implementing technology without any direct customer focus led to consulting, where I discovered [Business Modeling](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) and Value Proposition design. 
In grad school I learnt how to win at strategy with the right information and systems.
My research applies this to solve business problems in emerging markets.

I love simple design, maps, data and open-source systems. This is my personal digital log.
