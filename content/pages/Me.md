Title: Me
Date: 2020-08-28 21:38

I bring clarity of thought & quality execution to technology product management,  designing information systems that deliver value to customers.

Trained as an engineer, boredom implementing technology without any direct customer focus led to discovery of [Business Modeling](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) and Value Proposition design, and then to grad school to understand winning strategy with the right information and systems.
My research: applying information systems to solve business problems in emerging markets.

 Trusted across the full product life cycle to improve existing systems and create useful new solutions, my [top skills](https://secure.plum.io/p/o93Pr7IyMGN98jHG9suN5A) show a hands-on approach to learning and delivering value. 

I love simple design, maps, data and open-source systems. This is my personal digital log.
