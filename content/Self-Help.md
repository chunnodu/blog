Read of the year was this accidental find while reading The Toyota Way. What book could be so important that it was the only one framed in the Toyota museum? A practical guide for the aspiring "self-made" man, although nothing of the sort really exists. 
Through various stories of british inventors and entrepreneurs living in the 17/1800's it touches on all the great values an industrious, energetic person should possess for moving ahead. I'd always associated America with invention, forgetting the Brits did it at scale a hundred years before.

Here's a Twitter Moment of my favorite quotes from the book: https://twitter.com/i/events/1254446510877618177?s=20
