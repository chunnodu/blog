# As a Business Man, What do You Do?

An African #business man who was being interviewed about his profession, responded this way to the question: "As a #business man sir, what do you do?"
    I do #business
    I #deal on #deals
    If you have a #gooddeal
    You get it to me
    If I #like it
    I #buy your #deal
    If you have #money to #buy my own
    I give you my #bill
    You #pay
    And that's #business
