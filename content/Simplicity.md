Great find. Simplicity is one of those things everyone claims to love, but very few can implement systematically. This book had a lot of gems, but most important: To practice simplicity as a core value you have to intentionally design for and prioritize it.

Quotes: 

"Verbalizing forces precision on thoughts which are vagues, indistinct and apparently complex. You do not have to agree with what you just said to yourself."

"When designing, be clear about: values, priorities and considerations."
