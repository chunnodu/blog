Title: Table Stakes: Should Twitter have an End of The Year Round-up?

With consumer technology companies it's become increasingly common to see unique features quickly become table stakes:_the minimum offering needed to meet customer expectations_. The most referenced example of this is probably Stories, which started off on Snapchat and eventually became ubiquitous.

I think **usage analytics**: _showing users an aggregate of their activity on the platforms they engage with_ will soon be table stakes, and End of the Year Reviews are a great use case as folks get more introspective as they wrap up the year.

A good signal of trends is when users perform an action on one platform and share it across others. It means they liked it enough to share wherever they had an existing or larger network. Back in the day before Twitter had native photo sharing it was possible to share & view Instagram photos. My question of how the product team felt about it was quickly answered when Instagram [limited this feature](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/instagram-pulls-photos-from-twitter-completely/2012/12/10/8a23bb4a-42cb-11e2-8061-253bccfc7532_story.html), to keep users' photo viewing mainly confined to the platform where they originally posted. Sound business logic, too.

So, when I saw people share their end of the year recaps from [Spotify](https://2020.byspotify.com/) and [Apple Music](https://replay.music.apple.com/) on Twitter and knowing about its robust analytics features from the developer program, I wondered if the product team observed this cross-platform sharing and why they hadn't done a similar thing at the end of the year with their already existing data assets, especially as their Analytics aren't front and center or visible to the average user.

What would a Twitter yearly round up look like? I conceptualized it as an End of the Year report. While I make time to prototype this, here's a screen shot of my mindmap of how it would work under the hood.![screenshot](../images/TwitterEOY1.png )

In addition to aggregating descriptive stats, which twitter's Analytics feature already does, throwing in natural language processing (NLP) operations e.g Sentiment Analysis, Semantic Analysis and Bag of Words could yield some interesting results.

My hunch from daily interaction with users, is people could pay for it too.
